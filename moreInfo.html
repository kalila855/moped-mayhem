	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Hello! My name is Stephanie. In February 2015, I had the opportunity to go to Cambodia with my family to serve at Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE. My mother is an optometrist, and she was the first eye doctor to visit the hospital (able to use a prototype of innovative eye equipment...). My sister and I colected about 400 donated glasses from the Silicon Valley community and helped do preliminary eye vision tests. My father helped pass out and match glasses with perscriptions...For all patients, this was their very first eye exams.</p>

	<h3>The Patients & Culture</h3>
	<p>We gave vision tests and taught about eye health to workers at the hospital, a rural village, and a K-12 school....</p>
	<p>My family and I also experienced and learned about Cambodia's culture. We visited Angkor Wat, the Killing Fields Memorial, and the King's palace. We interacted with the locals....</p>

	<h3>Inspiration for the Game</h3>
	<p>A fun yet scary experience was learning how to cross the streets in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. This game was inspired by the city's roads. The roads had an ordered chaos. The street lines and lights were optional, and the mopeds, bikes, and cars all weaved in and out, avoiding many potential accidents. Through this game, Michelle, Kayleigh, and I wanted to convey a taste of Cambodian culture while raising awareness of Cambodia's medical needs....</p>

	<h3>The Need for Healthcare</h3>
	<p>We were able to help many (#__) people, but there is still dire need for not only eye care but also general health care. Most people in Cambodia cannot afford to see a doctor let alone travel and see one, and many still fall victim to curable sicknesses. Out of the city where most people live, there is very limited transportation options. Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE is doing an amazing job increasing access to health care to the needy in Cambodia, but they cannot fix this problem alone. Please consider donating today! Thank you!</p>
