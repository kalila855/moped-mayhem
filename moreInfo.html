	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Hello! My name is Stephanie. In February 2015, I had the opportunity to go to Cambodia with my family to serve at Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE. My mother is an optometrist and she was the first eye doctor to visit the hospital (able to use a prototype of innovative eye equipment...). My sister and I colected about 500 donated glasses from the Silicon Valley community and helped do preliminary eye vision tests. My father helped pass out and match glasses with perscriptions...For all patients, this was their very first eye exams.</p>

	<h3>The Patients & Culture</h3>
	<p>We gave vision tests and taught about eye health to workers at the hospital, a rural village, and a K-12 school...</p>
	<p>My family and I also experienced and learned about Cambodia's culture. We visited Angkor Wat, the Killing Fields Memorial, and the King's palace. We interacted with the locals...</p> 

	<p>Meet the patients: (pictures, personal stories) ...</p>

	<h3>Inspiration for the Game</h3>
	<p>A fun yet scary experience was learning how to cross the streets in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. This game was inspired by the city's roads. The roads had an ordered chaos. The street lines and lights were optional, and the mopeds, bikes, and cars all weaved in and out, somehow avoiding many potential accidents...</p>

	<h3>The Need for Healthcare</h3>
	<p>We were able to help ___ people, but there is still dire need for not only eye care, but also general health care. Most people in Cambodia cannot afford to see a doctor let alone access a good doctor. Please consider donating today!</p>
