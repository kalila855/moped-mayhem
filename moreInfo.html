	<h4><p>Hello! My name is Stephanie. In February 2015, I had the opportunity to go to Cambodia with my family to serve at Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE. My mother is an optometrist and she was the first eye doctor to visit the hospital. My sister and I colected about 500 donated glasses and helped do preliminary eye vision tests. My father helped pass out and match glasses with perscriptions...</p>

	<p>We gave vision tests and taught about eye health to workers at the hospital, a rural village, and a school.</p></h4>
